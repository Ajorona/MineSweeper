# MineSweeper

A coding project that I use to teach kids the basics of object-oriented programming in python. This is a CLI based game that covers how abstraction - here just the hiding of details - and the encapsulation, or grouping of, methods and data into a class makes writing a game that requires multiple objects (Board, Tile, Game) lucid and simple.

## Getting Started

Simply download the package and run the game from the CLI as python minesweeper

###Prerequisites

A Unix/Linux based system, the utilities are written for use on a Unix based system (MacOS, Ubuntu, etc.)

### Installing

There are no installation steps, this is a script that is run locally

### Running the tests

Test files are included but are not automated.
